      Distinguish how colour is used to represent data values visually. Use
      `scale_*_sequential()` to encode numerical information that has a
      natural order, `scale_*_diverging()` to encode numerical information that
      has a meaningful midpoint, and use `scale_*_qualitative()` to encode
      categories.
