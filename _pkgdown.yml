    desc: >
      Distinguish how colour is used to represent data values visually. Use
      `scale_*_sequential()` to encode numerical information that has a
      natural order (where data can be ordered from high to low, or vice versa),
      `scale_*_diverging()` to encode numerical information that is ordered and
      has a meaningful midpoint (for example, scales in a survey), and
      `scale_*_qualitative()` to encode categories that have no natural order.
