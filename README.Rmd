The scwplot package provides functions for applying consistent SCW-branded aesthetics to ggplot visualisations in R, as well as additional functionality that produces clean plots and makes plotting in R easier.

## Installation

scwplot is not available on CRAN. In order to install the package, you must do so directly from this GitHub repository with {devtools}, using the code below:

```{r}
#| label: install-scwplot
#| eval: false

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("NHS-South-Central-and-West/scwplot")
```

If you haven't already installed devtools, you will also have to run the first line of code in the code chunk.

## Usage

The primary purpose of scwplot is to extend the functionality of ggplot to create consistent SCW-style figures, so usage builds on top of basic [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) functionality.

A simple example of the scwplot usage:

```{r}
#| label: scwplot-basics
#| fig.width: 12
#| fig.height: 8
#| dpi: 300

library(ggplot2)
library(scwplot)

The package includes the following functionality:

- Themes - functions for controlling the display of plot theme elements.
- Colour - functions for incorporating the use of colour to display data.
- Images - functions for adding images (i.e., brand images and logos) to plots.
- Format - functions for applying final formatting to a plot and saving it to file.


## Acknowledgements

This package takes a lot of inspiration from the NHS-R community's [NHSRtheme](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRtheme) package and BBC's [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot) package. The code, the structure of the repository, and the approach taken to achieve the package's goals has been influenced by [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/).
