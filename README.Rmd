The scwplot package provides functions for applying consistent SCW-branded aesthetics to ggplot visualisations in R, as well as additional functionality that produces clean plots and makes plotting in R easier.

## Installation

scwplot is not available on CRAN. In order to install the package, you must do so directly from this GitHub repository with {devtools}, using the code below:

```{r}
#| label: install-scwplot
#| eval: false
#| tidy: true

# install.packages('devtools')

devtools::install_github("NHS-South-Central-and-West/scwplot")
```

If you haven't already installed devtools, you will also have to run the first line of code in the code chunk.

## Usage

There are six primary functions in the scwplot package. The functions can be subdivided into SCW theme functions and additional utility functions.

The SCW theme functions are as follows:

- ```scw_theme()```
- ```scale_fill_scw()``` and ```scale_colour_scw()```

While the following functions add additional utility to the package:

- ```add_commas()```
- ```finalise_plot()```

## Acknowledgements

This package takes a lot of inspiration from the NHS-R community's [{NHSRtheme}](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRtheme) package and BBC's [{bbplot}](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot) package.
